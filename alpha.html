        there is a strong argument that your competitive advantage and the situations they entail (being rich, having a lot of sex,  not having to work, etc.) are most suited to those who are most intelligent. This is to true to a certain extent, <b>but what is intelligence?</b>
        <br><br>
        the taleb argument is that measurements of intelligence like IQ are fraudulent not only because the normal distribution which it's founded on is inaccurate, but because <b>correlation of IQ and performance exist only in circular situations.</b> IQ is measured by taking a test, so if you score high on that test - you are likely to score high on school exams, military/corporate assessments, etc. This merely shows someone is good at taking tests and nothing else.
