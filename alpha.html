    <h5>an understanding of how to manipulate your environment is the foundation of competitive strategy. this is a result of advanced knowledge - pertaining to the mind. however, the mind is but an organ of the body.</h5>

    <h1>How to gain competitive advantage</h1>
    <p>
        Be a jacked nerd - limited energy in a day - optimization - development of the mind - what is it to study? - what is abstraction? - the mind is a tool of the body
        <br><br> 
        humans rule the world because of our ability to develop and utilize technology. <b>technology is the magnification of the will.</b> 
        <li>
            ingest as much information as possible
        </li>
        <li>
            develop a strong filter to determine what's important
        </li>
        <li>understand the limitations of your will</li>

        <li>develop solutions through trial and error</li>
        <li>ad infinium</li>
        <br>
        there is a strong argument that your competitive advantage and the situations they entail (being rich, having a lot of sex,  not having to work, etc.) are most suited to those who are most intelligent. This is to true to a certain extent, <b>but what is intelligence?</b>
        <br><br>
        the taleb argument is that measurements of intelligence like IQ are fraudulent not only because the normal distribution which it's founded on is inaccurate, but because <b>correlation of IQ and performance exist only in circular situations.</b> IQ is measured by taking a test, so if you score high on that test - you are likely to score high on school exams, military/corporate assessments, etc. This merely shows someone is good at taking tests and nothing else. 
        <br><br>
        So what does it mean to be intelligent? Efficient adaptability. <br>However, my case is that intelligence is not a single trait, but a complexity that results from habits of observation, abstraction, pattern recognition, risk-taking, revision, and persistence.  
        <br><br>
        Do you understand that this process is contingent on prior goals being set? That every abstraction is somehow related to advancing your position in your environment? Do you accept that everything you are, ever skills and genetic trait you have, was crafted for this purpose? <br>
        There is nothing purely abstract. Everything has a utility. Even the most obscure professors think the way they do for recognition in their university. Power takes many shapes, and many people have different standard.

        <h3>Being a jacked nerd</h3>
        Now that we know everything is rooted in the subject increasing thier position in their environment, it is natural to wonder why mentioning this is important.
        <br><br>
        Deeming intelligence as a key trait and being proud to live in abstraction should be recognized as a crime.
        <br> Doing so creates a culture of rent-seeking individuals who wish to achieve their means by impressing people and taking advantage of the system. Complacency is rewarded and innovation is meant to be peer reivewed.
        <br><br> Instead, one should strive to be strong, fearless, ruthless, and adaptive. To have all the traits of the nerd, but test them out with reality - the brutal, raw reality. To do so one needs to be strong. Be a jacked nerd.
