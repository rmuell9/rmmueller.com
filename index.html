        <h2>My Market Outlook: July 2024</h2>
        <h5>July 9, 2024</h5>
        <p>the equity market looks pretty insane right now.</p>
        <p>NVIDIA becomes the largest company by MC then loses almost a trillion $ in a few days, <br>
        Tesla slightly beats delivery estimates (still down YOY), then shoots up $80 per share a week.<br>
        Meta loses 10% when it beats estimates because Zuck talked about the Metaverse again, <br>but then goes up 6% because he posted himself wakeboarding in a tux.<br>
        and obviously meme stocks and crypto, which need no explanation</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>i think there are only two broad future scenarios: </p>
        <li>AI makes humanity unnecessary but the economy very efficient, so the market shoots up exponentially</li>
        <li>the national debt problem becomes too much of a problem, causing inflation and a continuing bull market, but ultimatly a horrible crash and possibly war</li>
        <p>a part of me thinks the second option is most likely, and the hype around AI is because the promise of efficiency would solve the debt problem.</p>
        <p>and i don't think LLMs will create AGI. Maybe i'm just hoping there is more to intelligence than creating statistical models based on empirical data </p>
        <p>and if AGI is unleashed, the incumbants will take the most advantage and there is less of a chance for young people to build their own empires</p>
        <p>it is an unfortunate thought that throughout history, fallen empires were usually replaced by more advanced and virtuous ones</p>
        <p>but having technology as our ruler would feel disconnected. all people would be commoditized if intelligence were no object</p>
        <p>i think that the socialist values will be taken to their natural conclusion in my lifetime</p>
        <p>there will be advancements made in longevity, technological (cowardly) warfare, and all of our current actions will be replaced by technology</p>
        <p>competition will be illusory and optional, and comfort will always be available.</p>
        <p>its unfortunate that this will happen in my lifetime, for what is really great about this is that when it falls, it's opposite will prevail</p>
        <p>and the tragedy of the human condition - with it's pain, disappointment, early death, and all its sudden losses - will be embraced, <br>because we know the consequences of neglecting human autonomy in attempt to solve this tragedy.</p>
