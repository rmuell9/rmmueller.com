### How does it exist?

Through a [static site generator](https://github.com/rmuell9/pySSG)
written in Python. One could pretentiously describe it as an isomorphism from
markdown to html.

The title on the tab bar changes because there is a 
[JavaScript program](https://github.com/rmuell9/rmmueller.com/blob/main/static/favicons.js) 
attached to this website. It is harmless.
