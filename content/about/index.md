My main _career_ ambition is to monetize leading-edge scientific research through technology.
Fields that interest me the most are nuclear energy, synthetic biology, and proprietary trading.


My _background_ is that I studied Finance and Mathematics at [University of Illinois Chicago](https://www.uic.edu/about/).


My interest in **Finance** stems from Karl Popper's [The Poverty of Historicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Poverty_of_Historicism),
which represents the problem of nondeterministic complex systems and applying the scientific method to society.


In **Mathematics**, I'm primarily interested in differential geometry and its physical applications in gravitation.


These ambitions are complex and I have _no academic interest_, so if you want to see how I learn, please visit the projects section. If you want to work together, please visit the contact section.
