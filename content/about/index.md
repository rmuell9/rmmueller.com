### About Me
My main interest right now is Pure Mathematics. I am focusing on the subfields of [Differential Geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry) and [Topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology).
However I am not yet commited to any graduate program pipelines.

When I need a break, I'm also into philosophy and building interesting things (some on my [GitHub](https://github.com/rmuell9)).

In the past I was a BJJ competitor and Muay Thai recreationalist.

If you got here from LinkedIn (or related), all of this is secondary to my passion of providing shareholder value.
