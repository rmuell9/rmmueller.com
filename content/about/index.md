###### Updated on Oct. 26, 2025

My background is that I studied Finance and Mathematics at the University of Illinois Chicago.

My primary interest in Mathematics is differential geometry and it's physical applications in gravitation.

My interest in Finance stems from Karl Popper's [The Poverty of Historicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Poverty_of_Historicism),
which represents the problem of nondeterministic complex systems.
