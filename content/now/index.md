# Now

##### What i'm working on now

- Main "learning" focuses: algebraic topology, manifold theory, and some nuclear engineering (when i'm feeling practical)

- Understanding languages better by [building an interpreter in Go](https://github.com/rmuell9/goInterpreter)

- Understanding LLMs better by [building an LLM from scratch](https://github.com/rmuell9/buildLLM)

- Getting better at Rust than I am at Python

- Rewritting my favorite programs I use in Linux - [power notifications](https://github.com/rmuell9/PyPower)
