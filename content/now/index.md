- Working through texts on [smooth manifolds](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Smooth-Manifolds-Graduate-Mathematics/dp/1441999817), [gravitation](https://www.amazon.com/Spacetime-Geometry-Introduction-General-Relativity/dp/1108488390), and [topology](https://www.amazon.com/Topology-Classic-Classics-Advanced-Mathematics/dp/0134689518)

- Understanding languages better by [building an interpreter in Go](https://github.com/rmuell9/goInterpreter)
