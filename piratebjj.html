        An intelligent action is one which minimizes energy expended while maximizing utility gained. Money is energy, and utility is BJJ knowledge.<br> - Matthew Mueller, Polymath, 2024

        <b>Step 1: the tools</b> <br>
        mindset: you gotta study brah. watch instructionals at 2x speed until you're mentally fatigued. listen to the best, dont trust your bjj coach. 
        <br><br>
        storage: terabox, free 1tb storage. it has ads tho and premium is only $2 a month for no ads and extra 1tb storage. dropbox and google drive are good too, but less space.
        <br><br>
        <b>Step 2: the sauce</b>
        <br><br>
        research: you can find all instructionals on billi billi (chinese youtube), rutracker, and mma torrents. there are also discord communities that share with each other, that is the best if you can find one.
        <br><br>
        youtube: a lot of bjj instruction on youtube is noise. after a point studying comp tape is more useful than dvds. also there is decades of wrestling and judo tape that is amazing. 
        <br><br>
        patreon: the best way to learn anything is to have a coach/tutor. patreon offers anyone the ability to get specific information from the best in the world and is an amazing resource
        <br><br>
        alternative data: bjjfanatics isnt the only way to learn online. there are many platforms like submeta or method.online that are less popular but also good. other examples could be training at gyms around the world, going to wrestling clubs, and watching forgotten DVDs like ryan hall's.
        <br><br>
        <b>Step 3: iteration</b>
        <br><br>
        study as much grappling as you until you cant study anymore even if you wanted to. then go into practice and have specific goals. try something new -> fail -> try again -> fail slightly less ...
